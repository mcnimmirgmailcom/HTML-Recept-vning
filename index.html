      <strong>Note:</strong> Use only the ripest tomatoes. Don't use a bread
      that's too flavorful (no sourdough, for example) or rough. You want it to
      soften and blend into the soup completely. You can serve the soup as is
      with a drizzle of olive oil, sherry vinegar, and a sprinkle of chives and
      ground black pepper, or you can add a few diced vegetables back to the
      smooth base for texture.

              Working in two batches as necessary, blend vegetables, juice, and bread at high speed, slowly drizzling olive oil and sherry vinegar into blender as it blends. Strain soup through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and black pepper. Serve, drizzling each bowl with olive oil, a few sprinkles of sherry vinegar, extra cracked black pepper, and chives.
