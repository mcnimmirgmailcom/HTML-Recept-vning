    <p>
      <strong>Note:</strong> Use only the ripest tomatoes. Don't use a bread
      that's too flavorful (no sourdough, for example) or rough. You want it to
      soften and blend into the soup completely. You can serve the soup as is
      with a drizzle of olive oil, sherry vinegar, and a sprinkle of chives and
      ground black pepper, or you can add a few diced vegetables back to the
      smooth base for texture.
